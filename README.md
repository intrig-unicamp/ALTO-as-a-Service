Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is a recently standardized protocol that provides abstract network topology and cost maps in addition
to endpoint information services that can be consumed by applications in order to become network-aware and take optimized decisions regarding traffic
flows.
In this work, we propose a public service based on the ALTO specification using public routing information available at the Brazilian Internet eXchange
Points (IXPs). Our ALTO server prototype takes the acronym of AaaS (ALTO-as-a-Service) and is based on over 2.5GB of real BGP data from the 25
Brazilian IX.br public IXPs.
We evaluate our proposal in terms of functional behaviour and performance via proof of concept experiments which point to the
potential benefits of applications being able to take smart endpoint selection decisions when consuming the developer-friendly ALTO APIs.
